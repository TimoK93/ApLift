This is the default folder for storing the output of tracking algorithms to be evaluated.

For MOT17, the output of a number of different trackers can be downloaded by clicking on each tracker in the list [here](https://motchallenge.net/results/MOT17/),
we have used [Lif_t](https://motchallenge.net/method/MOT=2809&chl=10) and [SSAT](https://motchallenge.net/method/MOT=3465&chl=10) for testing the code.

For MOT20 the output of a number of different trackers can be downloaded by clicking on each tracker in the list [here](https://motchallenge.net/results/MOT20/),
we have used [LPC_MOT](https://motchallenge.net/method/MOT=3334&chl=13) for testing the code.

We recommend storing trackers for different benchmarks in different subfolders.
E.g. *tracker_output/MOT17-train/Lif_t/* and *tracker_output/MOT20-train/LPC_MOT/*
